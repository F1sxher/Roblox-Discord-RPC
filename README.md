# Roblox Studio - Discord RPC (Rich Presence)

Show off your studio activities with ease & vast customization using my RPC client. This was heavily inspired by **[Rigid_Studio's Client](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/1086405)**

## Showcase

- Developing

- Playtesting

## Installation

**NODE.JS v16+, NPM v8+, AND GIT ARE _REQUIRED_**

### Server

- Go to the **[Github Page](https://github.com/fisherjacobc/Roblox-Discord-RPC)** and download the code.
- Open in your IDE of choice (VS Code I prefer :smile:)
- Open a command window and run the command `./SETUP`
  - This should install files and start automatically!
  - In the future, run `./START` to run it

### Client

- Install the plugin **[from roblox](https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/11231863405)**
- Or, add the plugin from the plugin folder (on the github page) to the local plugins folder.
  _Doing both is not recommended_

## Features!

- **Game Icon showing**
- **Busy Status**
- **Studio Customization Widget**
- **Timestamps**
- **Player Count (developing/testing)**
- **Up to _TWO_ fully customizable buttons (not working as of v1.0.0)**
- **➕ more!**

## Known Issues/TODO

- **Testing frequently switches back and forth between the active & testing statuses**
  - There has been no found _permanent_ solution for this and is kind of an important feature
- Buttons do not work yet
- Make a script to auto install/download server files
- Scripting details doesnt update unless u go to no script, and then go to a script
